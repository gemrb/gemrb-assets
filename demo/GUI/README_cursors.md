# Implementation details

The filename suffix numbers match ie_cursors.h / original data:
- even indices are main cursors
- odd indices are the pressed versions
  - these were created by rotating by 8Â° around point (8,8)

The filename prefix is what you should set MainCursorsImage tag to in gemrb.ini.
